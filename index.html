  <p>
  The Lattice Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (LQCD) SciDAC-4 Project is
  supported by the U.S. Dept. of Energy Office of Nuclear Physics and
  the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research. The project is
  supporting the development software infrastructure to carry out scientific
  calculations in support of the U.S. Nuclear Physics
  program. It is a collaboration of domain
  scientists, and computer scientists which aims to understand the structure of matter under
  extreme conditions, and how quarks and gluons are confined to build
  the matter that is observed in nature.

      <br/><br/>
Jefferson Lab leads development of next-generation software to benefit
      nuclear physics computation. An award was recently announced by DOE’s Office of Nuclear Physics and the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research in the Office of Science. It will provide $8.25 million for the “Computing the Properties of Matter with Leadership Computing Resources” research project.
