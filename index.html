  <p> The Lattice Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (LQCD) SciDAC-4 Project is
  supported by the U.S. Dept. of Energy Office of Nuclear Physics and
  the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research. The project is
  supporting the development of the software infrastructure to carry
  out scientific calculations to address fundamental questions in
  nuclear science. It is a collaboration of domain scientists, and
  computer scientists which aims to understand the structure of
  nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and how quarks and gluons
  are confined to build the matter that is observed in nature.  </p>

Jefferson Lab leads development of next-generation software to benefit
      nuclear physics computation. An award was recently announced by DOE’s Office of Nuclear Physics and the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research in the Office of Science. It will provide $8.25 million for the “Computing the Properties of Matter with Leadership Computing Resources” research project.

          Tetraquark operators explored in the charm sector
        </a>
      </h3>

      <p>
      <i>arXiv preprint 1709.01417</i>
      <br/><br/>

      A new preprint reports on work lead by DAMTP student Gavin
      Cheung into the importance of including local <i>"tetraquark"</i>
      operators into a basis of meson-meson operators in the doubly
      charmed $I=0$ and hidden charm $I=1$
      sectors. The paper shows that the addition of tetraquark
      operators does not substantively change the spectrum of states,
      which is found to show no sign of featuring clear narrow
      resonances or bound-states.
