  <p> The Lattice Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (LQCD) SciDAC-4 Project is
  supported by the U.S. Dept. of Energy Office of Nuclear Physics and
  the Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research. The project is
  supporting the development of the software infrastructure to carry
  out scientific calculations to address fundamental questions in
  nuclear science. It is a collaboration of domain scientists, and
  computer scientists which aims to understand the structure of
  nuclear matter under extreme conditions, and how quarks and gluons
  are confined to build the matter that is observed in nature.  </p>

        <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1816019" style="text-decoration:none">Three-pion scattering amplitude</a>
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
     For the first time in lattice QCD, a three-hadron scattering amplitude has been determined using a general workflow that does not make use of model assumptions or a perturbative expansion. Focusing on the maximum isospin three-pion channel ($\pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^+$) the calculation uses a relativistic finite-volume formalism to relate lattice energies to the physical scattering amplitude. The work has been published in  <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.012001"
 style="text-decoration:none">Physical Review Letters</a> as an Editor’s Suggestion.

      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
      For the first time in lattice QCD, a calculation has shown the
 presence of an exotic $1^{-+}$ state appearing as an unstable
 <i>resonance</i>. The result shows that the longstanding model-based
 proposal that such a state would couple more strongly to the $\pi
 b_1$ final-state than the lower-lying $\pi \eta, \pi \eta'$ and $\pi
 \rho$ final-states is confirmed. Possible implications for the
 recently observed $\pi_1$ experimental candidate state are discussed. The calculation appears in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10034.pdf"
 style="text-decoration:none">preprint posted to the arXiv</a>,
 and has been accepted for publication in Physical Review D.

      <br/><br/>
      For the first time, lattice QCD calculations run at NERSC
      allowed nuclear physicists to determine the pressure
      distribution inside a proton, taking into account the
      contributions of the proton’s fundamental particles: quarks and
      gluons. This discovery brings nuclear scientists closer to a
      complete understanding of a proton’s structure and the
      fundamental particles that make up most of the visible matter in
      the universe.

          Accelerating QCD Gauge Generation on GPUs

      <i>SciDAC-4 Highlight, 2018-05-01</i>
      <br/><br/>
The generation of gauge configurations (samples of the strong force
      field in the vacuum) is the gating first step of nuclear and
      high energy physics calculations using lattice quantum
      chromodynamics (LQCD) generating the data on which subsequent
      calculations depend. 
Here, we demonstrate a 73x reduction in the GPU-hours required for the generation of such gauge fields
       moving from Titan to Summit, and incorporating new algorithms
      well suited to the new system. The improvement on  Summit enables calculations which where hitherto considered out-of reach for reasons of computational cost, and will fundamentally re-shape how we will conduct our scientific campaigns in the future.

          Tetraquark operators explored in the charm sector
        </a>
      </h3>

      <p>
      <i>arXiv preprint 1709.01417</i>
      <br/><br/>

      A new preprint reports on work lead by DAMTP student Gavin
      Cheung into the importance of including local <i>"tetraquark"</i>
      operators into a basis of meson-meson operators in the doubly
      charmed $I=0$ and hidden charm $I=1$
      sectors. The paper shows that the addition of tetraquark
      operators does not substantively change the spectrum of states,
      which is found to show no sign of featuring clear narrow
      resonances or bound-states.
