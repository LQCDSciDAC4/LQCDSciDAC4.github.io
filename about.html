<div>

<p>This project is supporting the software development that will allow for calculations using lattice Quantum Chromodynamics methods to exploit the new generation of leadership-class resources and dedicated hardware to address fundamental questions in nuclear science. This project has impact on current heavy ion experiments at RHIC and LHC, the study of excited and exotic states of hadrons at CLAS-12 and GlueX at JLab, the hadron structure programs at RHIC-spin and JLab, the low-energy nuclear physics programs at FRIB, and future fundamental symmetries programs.</p>

<p>The diverse array of architectures and communication fabrics in the new generation of leadership resources - Cori, Theta, Summit, and Aurora -  presents a challenge for the performance portability of HPC codes. We have assembled a team of domain scientists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians to address the challenge of adapting and evolving our LQCD code suites - including Chroma, QLua and QUDA - to efficiently utilize and exploit these new resources. </p>

<p>The project efforts are critical for our program to have the maximal impact on the US theoretical and experimental programs in nuclear science within the next 5 years. All our software development efforts will benefit the US programs in lattice QCD and will be coordinated to have maximal impact on these programs as well as the experimental programs.</p>
